## How It Works

1. The program monitors right-click inputs and identifies when the grappler is in your selected slot.
2. It automatically executes:
   - Releasing the right mouse button.
   - Firing the grappler.
   - Switching to the shotgun.
3. The process minimizes animation delays, allowing for fluid transitions.
